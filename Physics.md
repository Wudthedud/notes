In an experiment investigating frontal collisions, we analyzed the effectiveness of crash barriers and crumple zones by measuring parameters such as velocity, peak force, speed, and rebound. The principles of momentum and impulse are integral to understanding how these safety features work. In a collision, the momentum of the vehicle must be brought to zero, and the impulse (the change in momentum) experienced by the vehicle is directly related to the force and duration of the impact.

To ensure reliable results, our experiment maintained a constant speed, acknowledging that speed is a critical factor in the severity of a crash. Higher speeds result in greater kinetic energy, which must be managed during a collision. This kinetic energy, when not properly absorbed, translates into large impact forces that can cause significant injuries, as the human body is not equipped to withstand such forces over a brief period.

Crumple zones are designed to mitigate these forces by extending the time over which the collision occurs, thereby reducing the peak force experienced by the occupants. In head-on collisions, crumple zones absorb much of the kinetic energy, preventing it from reaching the passenger cabin. Even in lower-speed crashes, crumple zones are highly effective, absorbing nearly all the energy and protecting the occupants.

Crash barriers, however, are primarily intended for high-speed impacts, which is why they are commonly found on highways and motorways. Their robust design ensures that they can withstand and dissipate the high forces involved in such collisions, preventing vehicles from colliding with dangerous obstacles or oncoming traffic.
