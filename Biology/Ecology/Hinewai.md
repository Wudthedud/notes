Your report: 
Hinewai is a reserve 1250 hectares in area, located in the south-east area of Banks Peninsula. It was originally covered by native forest, but after human occupation, most of the forest was destroyed and replaced with pasture or shrubs such as Gorse (*Ulex europaeus*). It was bought by the Maurice White Forest Trust in September 1987, with only 109 hectares originally. Over the past 34 years, Hinewai Reserve has aimed to regenerate its native forest by using Gorse as a nurse canopy for the native plants. By October of 2000, they had replaced most of the grass pastures with Gorse and native forest. In another 12 years, there was a reduction in gorse and the reserve was mostly covered by native forest, with the gorse providing shade and allowing native seeds to germinate. As the native trees matured, they took over and shaded out the gorse. This demonstrated the effectiveness of using Gorse as a nurse canopy for regeneration. However, in 2011 when a fire broke out due to a thunderstorm, approximately 300 hectares of the reserve was burning for 27 hours. The aftermath of the fire saw the gorse thicken across the burned areas, providing additional shade and shelter for the native species to resprout. 

The ecological pattern shown in Hinewai is succession. Secondary succession is when
