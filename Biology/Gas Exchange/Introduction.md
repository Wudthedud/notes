  1. You have to compare the difference in the adaptations across the three animals ⟶ i.e. do they achieve gas exchange differently? Why?
2. What are the limitations and advantages involved in each gas exchange system (mammals, fish, insects)

Breathing is simply the process of moving air in and our of our lungs.
- We need to move this air into our lings as we need oxygen in order to make energy
The process of making energy in our body is called respiration
- The process of respiration releases energy from glucose and oxygen and produces carbon dioxide and water as waste products
- Glucose + Oxygen ⟶ Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy
- Therefore organisms need to get oxygen into their cells to produce energy. But, they also need to remove Carbon Dioxide (waste product). The movement of these gases across a gas exchange surface is called Gas Exchange

1. Large surface area:
	 A big surface area maximizes are over which gas exchange can occur. Larger surface area ⟶ more particles can diffuse per second. This is done through the alveoli in mammals.
2. Moist surface:
	Gases have to be dissolved in water to pass across a membrane (or surface will dry up and shrivel)
3. Thin surface:
	To allow for gases to diffuse quickly across the surface (diffusion is less efficient over larger distances, as more time is required)
