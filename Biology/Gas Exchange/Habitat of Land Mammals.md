Land mammals live in a diverse environment exposed to air. The amount of oxygen available = 21% in air. 
Insects tend to live in extreme, dry environments, exposed to air. The amount of oxygen available = 21% in air. 
Fish live in an aquatic environment, exposed to water. The amount of oxygen available is ~1% in water. 

#### Mammalian lung advantages
- One advantage is their circulatory system (using blood to transport O2 and CO2 around the body) Their size therefore isn't limited ⟶ no matter how big the mammal gets, every cell will have a capillary delivering system. 
	- Size isn't limited ⟶ Blood circulatory system
- Having 600 million alveoli allows for a huge surface area, allowing more O2 and CO2 to diffuse at once. This allows respiration to occur. 
	- 600 million alveoli, ↑ surface area, ↑diffusion though gas
- Having lungs interna to the body helps to reduce water loss (from being exposed to air), maintaining a moist gas exchange surface (gases can dissolve + diffuse). This allows mammals to live in many terrestrial habitats.
	-  Internal system, moist environment's
- This highly branched structure of the lungs (trachea ⟶bronchi ⟶ bronchioles ⟶ alveoli) again ensures a large surface area for diffusion of gases
	- trachea + branched structure ↑ surface area
- The high concentration of oxygen in air (21% vs 1% in water) is of major benefit to mammals. Mammals can therefore, easily move enough oxygen into the lungs (maintaining a concentration gradient)
	- High diffusion gradient ↑ ability to move O2
- Alveoli are covered in surfactant which helps prevent desiccation (and hols alveoli open) maintaining a moist, large surface for efficient gas exchange to occur. This is necessary as living in a dry environment (air) can easily lead to desiccation. 
	- Surfactant allows alveoli to stay moist
- Alveoli are surrounded by capillaries with a very thin wall. This means the diffusion distance for gases is only 0.0002 cm allowing diffusion of gases to occur efficiently]
	- 0.0002 cm capillaries ↓thickness

#### Mammalian lung limitations
- Dead space is the volume of air which is inhaled that does not take part in the gas exchange because it remains in the lungs. In other words, not all the air in each breath is available for the exchange of O2 and CO2 (usually about 150ml)
	- Dead space ⟶ not all gas is exchanged
- Air flow is 'tidal' in mammals, moving back and forth into and out of the lungs along the same path. As a result, air coming into a mammal's lungs is mixed with old air (air that has been in the lungs for a while) & this mixed air has less O2. This reduced the concentration gradient. 
	- 1 hole in/out
- Because land mammals live in a dry habitat they have to constantly keep their gas exchange surfaces moist to prevent desiccation. The gas exchange surface is also warm and continuously ventilated, making it a site of significant water loss (despite being internal). Humans exhale over a cup of water each day. 
	- Lose 1 cup of water daily
- Having a warm, moist gas exchange surface also makes it prone to infection. Respiratory illnesses, such as col and flu can also be easily transmitted when droplets containing bacteria/viruses are coughed or sneezed into the air and then breathed in by others. 
	- Prone to infections
- Lungs don't work efficiently in low O2 habitats, like water. Lungs can only extract 20% of available oxygen (vs 80% for fish) so wouldn't handle lower oxygen content in water.
	- Bad in low O2 environments

#### Adaptations
###### Structural
- Rings of cartilage along the trachea
	The air pressure around us would crush the walls of the trachea, but we have rounds of cartilage to strengthen the trachea. The rings also retain flexibility in the trachea, as solid cartilage would give little movement. 
- The branching nature of the breathing tubes 
	Trachea ⟶ Bronchi ⟶ Bronchioles and ending in alveoli sets up a huge surface area for gas exchange to occur.
 - Lungs are set deep inside the body cavity to keep the humidity high and the surfaces moist for gas exchange
 - Wall of capillaries and alveoli made up of a single cell layer respectively so that it is as thin as possible for diffusion to occur efficiently.

###### Physiological
- Haemoglobin is a protein that makes up red blood cells and reversibly binds oxygen and carbon dioxide, so the gasses can be transported exchanged between body cells and alveoli.
-  The surfactant liquid coats the inside of the alveoli. Its function is two-fold: It provides a moist membrane for gas exchange and also acts like a detergent which decreases the surface tension of water within the alveoli. If not, surface tension of water could collapse the walls of the alveoli. 
	 Note: Surface tension causes water molecules to be attracted to each other, which in turn could pull the walls of the alveoli in on themselves.

###### Behavioural
 - Stopping to rest when the body is out of breath to allow the body to 'catch a breath'

| Large surface area             | Bronchi divides into many bronchioles ending in huge numbers of alveoli 300 million per ling | Provides a large surface (100m³), which is needed for efficient for gas exchange (O₂ and CO₂) between the lungs and the bloodstream.
