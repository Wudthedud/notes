Why can't fish survive out of water?
- No adaptations for moisture ⟶ O₂ and CO₂ would not be able to dissolve therefore diffuse
- Filaments and lamellae would stick together, reducing surface area for gas exchange ⟶ fish would not be able to exchange O₂ and CO₂  quickly enough to meet cell demand
##### Countercurrent Flow
If fish were to use parallel flow, they would be wasting a lot of their gas exchange surface and the percentage of oxygen in the blood could never get very high. 

The most oxygen rich water comes into contact with the most oxygen rich blood, the most oxygen poor water comes into contact with the most oxygen poor blood
A favourable exchange gradient is maintained across the whole gas exchange surface

Lamellae ⟶ folds on the gill
1. Water passes through/filters through lamellae
2. As water moves through lamella, oxygen concentration goes down, as O₂ is absorbed by fish
3. 
4. 

##### Adaptations
- Fish will not face the problem of desiccation 'drying out' which affect mammals and insects as the gills are constantly kept moist because of the environment they live in. Gases can dissolve and then diffuse. 
- The counter current system (blood and water flowing on opposite directions) allows fish to extract 80% of available oxygen (vs mammals who can only extract 20% of available oxygen in air)
- The unidirectional flow of water is another advantage. Once the oxygen has been absorbed from water, the water leaves the body through the operculum. All of the water passing over the gills has oxygen in it (vs tidal ventilation in mammals and insects)
- This system is only efficient in water as the buoyancy of the water helps keeps filaments apart. On land they would stick together drastically reducing the surface area 
- Water is also harder to ventilate (move) than air because it is denser, so fish have use energy for ventilation. 
- Oxygen need in aquatic environments are much lower than that found in air (1% vs 21%). As a consequence, most fish are cold-blooded (bring warm-blooded requires more energy).
- Fish need to live in water as the gills would dry out without water keeping them moist
##### Fish and mammals similariies
Because the gas exchange surfaces are linked to the circulatory system, oxygen can be transported to cells far away from the exchange surface. This means that fish and mammals can grow relatively large. 
Note: In insects, the gas exchange system isn't linked to a transport system, meaning that their size is constrained
