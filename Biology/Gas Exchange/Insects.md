1. Outside air
2. Spiracles (openings)
3. Tracheae
4. Tracheoles
Trachea walls are reinforced with chitin - which allows insects to flex and stretch without developing kinks that might restrict air flow

What prevents insects from being big
- Diffusion of O₂ and CO₂ in tracheal tubes is fast enough for distances less than 1cm from the body surface. This limits the size/radius of the insect's body
- In larger organisms the number and length of tracheal runes needed would significantly increase the organism's weight, restricting movement (too heavy)
