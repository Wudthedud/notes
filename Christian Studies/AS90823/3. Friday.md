One of the most important aspects of Mainstream Protestant Christianity and Moderate Islam is the idea of life after death and what happens when you die. This affects their daily lives, as well as having wider implications such as around war and suffering.
Both Muslims and Christians believe that there is life after death, and that you can either go to a place of Heaven or Paradise, a place of perfect happiness, peace and eternal communion with God, or Hell, a place of suffering and punishment. They also both believe that there will be a day of judgement, where we will be judged by God or Allah, and if you reject God or Allah you would not be able to go to Heaven.
In Christianity, life after death is made possible through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christians believe that those who follow Jesus will go to heaven, a place of eternal happiness and peace. This is shown in John 11:25, where Jesus says, "The ones who believe in me will live, even though they die." By putting faith in Jesus and living according to his teachings, we can receive salvation and gain eternal life in heaven. Jesus' sacrificial death restored humanity's relationship with God. By taking our place and dying for our sins, Jesus enabled our sins to be forgiven and bridged the gap between us and God, allowing us to have a personal relationship with Him through Jesus.
Like how Christians who follow Jesus get saved, in Islam, if you followed Allah, you would be able to go to Jannah or Paradise. If you did not believe in Allah or was an enemy of Islam, you would not be able to go to paradise and would be sent to hell for eternity, there are multiple levels of both heaven and hell. This can be seen in the Qu'ran 2:28, where it says "How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were dead and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, and again will bring you to life; and then to Him you will be returned." The idea of paradise in Islam is similar to heaven, described as a place of eternal bliss, with beautiful gardens and freedom from thirst or hunger. To get to paradise, Muslims have to do good deeds in their life, with the journey to paradise described as a narrow bridge with hell underneath. When you die, you would remain until the day of judgement, where Allah will come and judge whether you go to paradise or hell. If you are weighed down by your sins, you would fall off the bridge into hell. Though, if you believed in Allah, Muslims believe that you would still be able to return to heaven after having suffered enough in hell. Salvation for Muslims can be achieved through faith in Allah, as well as doing good deeds and following the 5 pillars (fasting, tithing, praying, pilgrimage and declaration).
Both Christianity and Islam believe in the resurrection of the dead but there are some mayor differences. For example, in Christianity we believe that Jesus as God and the only one who can save us through our faith in him, but in Islam, Jesus is only a prophet and not God. This is because Muslims don't believe in the trinity, rather there is only one God. Qu'ran 2:163 says: "Your God is only One God. There is no god worthy of worship except Him - the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful." This means that for Christians, we are saved by Jesus and the grace of God, but in Islam they are saved by the deeds that they did in their lives, their adherence to the five pillars and their faith in Allah.
The significance of their beliefs can be seen in the way Christians and Muslims live their lives. As both religions believe that there is life after death and that you would be judged on the day of judgement, For example, in Christianity we put our faith in him and strive to live the way according to his teaching and like how he lived his life. The way Christians should live was summarized by Jesus in 2 great commandments: "Love God with all your soul, mind, heart and strength." and "Love your neighbor as yourself." By following these commandments, Christians can strive to be more like Jesus in their lives, and it guides us in our relationship with God. It also shows us how to treat other people in our lives and serves as our moral compass. By loving others as ourselves, we are told to treat others how we want to be treated, thereby giving us an example on how we should live life and put into action the teachings of Jesus. Unlike Islam, we are saved by our faith, not our works due to the grace of God.
The requirement for Muslims to get saved is faith that Allah is God and Muhammed is his prophet, but they also get judged on the deeds that they did during their life. This affects how Muslims live as well as their thoughts and actions. It motivates them to do good deeds, follow the 5 pillars and to be righteous, since they would be rewarded with paradise, otherwise they face punishment in hell. A difference from Christianity is that if you believed in Allah but still did bad deeds during your lives, you would eventually be able to enter paradise after you had suffered enough. An exception to this is if you died fighting in a holy war, then you would immediately go to paradise, even though you killed other people. Along with the good deeds and faith, Muslims also have to follow the 5 pillars: Shahadah, a declaration that Allah is God and Muhammed his prophet. Salah, prayer, which is done at dawn, dusk, midday, afternoon, and night. Zakat, tithing, which they have to tithe 2.5%. Sawm, fasting during Ramadan between dawn and dusk. Hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca, the birthplace of Muhammed. By doing these 5 things each day, their faith in Allah is solidified and reminds them that the material things that they have are all from Allah, and to appreciate what they have.
A wider implication of life after death for both Christians and Muslims can be seen in their ideas of war. For Christians, a war is justified when it has a just cause: to protect yourself from attack.
In Christianity, the belief in eternal judgement and going to Heaven or Hell can influence war. The main criteria that makes war just for many Christians is when a war is fought as protection from external attack. This can be seen in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter where it says: "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if a armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations." We justify war as a means to defend our faith and protect others from evil, however, the bible also teaches us peace and reconciliation. This can be seen in Jesus' teachings in Matthew 5:44 to "love your enemies." This means many Christians also to advocate for nonviolent and pacifist solutions to problems. This emphasis on love and forgiveness in the bible can also act as a restraint against war.
Similarly, in Islam, the belief in an afterlife also influences their ideas on war. Jihad, meaning struggle or strive, which can be shown not only through war but also through kindness and doing good deeds. The main reasons Islam fights is to protect the weak, humble and oppressed. It is seen as a last resort can it should be just, with good intention. This can be seen when Muhammad said: "O people! Do not desire a combat with the enemy, but pray to Allah for safety. But when you are face to face with the enemy be steadfast." Though, Jihad must be launched against an enemy who attacks Muslims, to defend their own faith and fight against oppression. In Islam, when you die fighting in a holy war, you wouldn't go to hell even though you killed other people, instead you would go straight to paradise. This motivates Muslims to fight for their beliefs, speak out against oppression and work toward establishing justice, since it would bring them reward in the afterlife.
Both Christian and Islamic teachings emphasize the importance of ethical conduct in war. The idea that ultimately, your actions will be judged by God or Allah on the day of judgement means that people will aim for peace and have the right intentions. This can be seen in the Qu'ran where it says "The reward of deeds depends on the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended. This also affects the way that they act during war, with both having similar ideas that non-combatants and the wounded and prisoners of war should be treated well.
Another wider implication is suffering, Suffering, a universal human experience for both Christians and Muslims.
In Christianity, suffering can seen as an opportunity to deepen our relationship with God and develop patience and humility. This provides hope in difficult times and can lead to a better outlook on life. We are called to "bear one another's burdens" (Galatians 6:2) and support each other in times of suffering.Similarly, in Islam, suffering is viewed as a test that can lead to spiritual growth. By enduring hardship with patience and faith, Muslims believe they can earn greater reward in the afterlife.Muslims are encouraged to help those in need through charity, acts of kindness, and community support, motivated by the belief that helping others will lead to a reward. Suffering is seen as part of Allah's plan, and Muslims believe that there is wisdom behind every trial, even if it is not immediately apparent.
Both religions also emphasize the importance of standing up against injustice and oppression. In Christianity, the teachings of Jesus emphasize standing up for the marginalized and opposing systems of injustice, leading to a proactive approach in addressing social and political issues. In Islam, the concept of jihad includes not only the internal struggle against sin but also the struggle to promote justice and protect the vulnerable.
