#### Islam - 5 Pillars
The Five Pillars of Islam are the foundation of a Muslim's life, providing a framework for daily activities and beliefs. They are essential obligations that demonstrate a Muslim's commitment to their faith. By fulfilling these pillars, a Muslim shows that their faith is not just a belief, but a guiding principle for their daily life.

**Shahadah**
> "There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet."
 
Shahadah is a declaration of the Islamic faith, anyone who doesn't recite this wholeheartedly cannot be a Muslim. 

When a Muslim recites this they proclaim that Allah is the only God, and that Muhammad is his prophet, that they personally accept this as true and will obey all the commitments of Islam in their life. Shahadah detaches one from finite and false masters

**Salat**
> "Salat is the obligatory Muslim prayers, performed five times each day by Muslims."

God ordered Muslims to pray at five set times of day:
1. Salat al-fajr: dawn, before sunrise
2. Salat al-zuhr: midday, after the sun passes its highest
3. Salat al-'asr: the late part of the afternoon
4. Salat al-maghrib: just after sunset
5. Salat al-'isha: between sunset and midnight

- All Muslims try to do this. Muslim children as young as seven are encouraged to pray. Prayer sets the rhythm of the day. It is a universal connective Muslim ritual and the set prayers are not just phrases to be spoken. Prayer for a Muslim involves uniting mind, soul, and body in worship; so a Muslim carrying out these prayers will perform a whole series of set movements that go with the words of the prayer.
- Muslims don't pray for God's benefit, they pray because God has told them that they are to do this, and because they believe that they obtain great benefit in doing so.
- Muslims pray direct to God, a Muslim prays as if standing in the presence of Allah.
- Muslims must be clean before they pray. They make sure of this by performing ritual washing, called wudhu. Mosques have washing facilities.
- Salat detaches one from the affairs of the world.

**Zakat**
Zakat is the compulsory giving of a set proportion of one's wealth to charity. It is regarded as a type of worship and of self-purification.
Zakat does not refer to charitable gifts given out of kindness or generosity, but to the systematic giving of 2.5% of one's wealth each year to benefit the poor.

The benefits of Zakat, apart from helping the poor, are as follows:
- Obeying God
- Helping a person acknowledge that everything comes from God on loan and that we do not really own anything ourselves
- And since we cannot take anything with us when we die we need not cling to it
- Acknowledging that whether we are rich or poor is God's choice So we should help those he has chosen to make poor
- Learning self-discipline
- Freeing oneself from the love of possessions and greed
- Freeing oneself from the love of money
- Freeing oneself from love of oneself
- Behaving honestly
- Zakat detaches one from the pangs of material wealth.

**Sawm**
Sawm is fasting. Muslims are required to fast during Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar.
During the 29/30 days of Ramadan all adult Muslims must give up the following things during the hours of daylight:
- Food or drink of any sort
- Smoking, including passive smoking
- Sexual activity
- Muslims who are physically or mentally unwell may be excused some of these, as may those who are under twelve years old, the very old, those who are pregnant, breast-feeding, menstruating, or travelling.
- If an adult does not fast for the reasons above they should try to make up the fast at a later date, or make a donation to the poor instead.
- Muslims do not only abstain from physical things during Ramadan. They are also expected to do their best to avoid evil thoughts and deeds as well.

There are many good reasons for this fast, including:
- Obeying God
- Learning self-discipline
- Becoming spiritually stronger
- Appreciating God's gifts to us
- Sharing the sufferings of the poor and developing sympathy for them
- Realising the value of charity and generosity
- Giving thanks for the Holy Qur'an, which was first revealed in the month of Ramadan
- Sharing fellowship with other Muslims

Sawm detaches one from the physical desires and emotional impulses
