Personal Response 4 Draft 1

What is a hero? Set in Gotham City, Batman by Christopher Nolan explores the ideas of good and evil, and challenging what our idea of a hero really is. To stop the Joker and the other gangs in Gotham City, we are introduced to Batman, a masked vigilante who is outside of the law who does what he wants, and Harvey Dent, the upright district attorney who puts criminals behind bars the lawful way.

A character that stood out to me was the Joker, who is described by Heath Ledger (his actor) as a "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy." Throughout the movie, his main motive was to and get people to break their moral code as well as societal order, because "The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules." This reminds me of Roger from Lord of the Flies, who wants to break the societal order, showing his true colours and enjoying the freedom of not having any rules. By the end of the novel, he ends up like the Joker, with no moral code and willing to torture people for his own enjoyment.  

I questioned the feasibility of these characters and their depictions of someone with no moral code. In contrast to the crime ridden Gotham city, being sheltered in a country such as New Zealand with laws and societal order means that I have never encountered anyone without a moral code.

- does everyone have moral boundaries?

- inequality, corruption, fragility of social order in our world today

- chaos and anarchy during social instability

- trump shooting, no motive, perhaps like the joker wants to see chaos?

- wants to send a message, see the world burn

- mental health issues, phycopath, impact in our world

One of the main themes of the movie was the fight between good and evil. Christopher Nolan uses Harvey Dent: the traditional hero and Batman: “whoever Gotham needs him to be” to demonstrate this.  

- do the ends justify the means

- do bad things for a good reason

Christopher Nolan uses the Joker to demonstrate this, whose sole purpose is to get people to break their moral code and prove humanity’s evil nature. Throughout the movie, he attempts to get Batman to break his moral code of not killing, and to get Gotham’s “White knight,” Harvey Dent to torture and commit crimes: "I took Gotham's white knight and brought him down to our level."
