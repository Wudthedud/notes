Year 12 Internal Assessment – Highly Recommended
Credits: 4 Reading Credits
Date Due:  End of Week One, Term 4

Task:
- Pupils need to compile a book list suitable for Year 12 pupils to read.
- Pupils need to independently select, read, and write responses that show personal engagement for at least 6 different texts.
- Pupils must form developed personal responses for each of the texts that are supported with evidence from the text.

Of the 6 texts, at least 4 must be written texts, 2 of which must be extended written texts.  The remaining 2 can be visual, oral, or written.

Possible text types may include:
- Novels
- Graphic Novels
- Biographies
- Autobiographies
- Films
- Dramas
- Short Stories
- Poems
- Short films
- Song lyrics
- Magazine articles

Texts must be suitable for reading at Year 12 level.  Therefore, it is vital that you check with your teacher before you read and respond to a text, especially if you are doing an extended text.
You need to incorporate a range of text types, genres, and ideas.

Things you will need to show in your responses:

- demonstrating significant personal understandings of, engagement with, and viewpoints on the texts
- making connections between texts
- making links between the texts and yourself – making clear connections between the text and your personal experiences and prior understandings
- making links between the texts and the world – making clear connections with the social, cultural, literary, political, or historical contexts presented in the texts.

Support your responses and recommendations with evidence, such as specific examples from the texts, quotations, and other relevant details.
