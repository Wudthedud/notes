[[Task Criteria]]
The following is a template that you could use if you wanted to write a response.  You do not have to stick with it, but it does give you some options.
Ideally, you will respond in depth to two elements of the text.  Doing more is fine, but it is the perception of the response that will get you an Excellence and not the length of the response itself.

#### Structure
1. This is a SMALL paragraph where you give a plot summary of your text (what it is about).  This is no longer than 3-4 (1-2) sentences
2. What is the first aspect you are responding to?  Say what it is.   Most importantly, give a quotation from the text that backs up what you are saying.  Explain why this aspect is important.  How does it link to your life?  How might it link to the wider world?  Finish with a sentence or two underlining the importance of the aspect.
3. Do the same as Paragraph Two, but for a different aspect.
4. Conclude your response. Say why you liked/disliked the text.  Explain why it would be important for a Year 12 pupil to read or not read.  Finish with an overall link to your life.

#### Aspects you could talk about
- Key ideas from the text
- Characters that stood out to you
- Decisions/actions that happened in the text and why they were important
- A setting that had relevance
- A conflict that happened
- Language that was used in an interesting way
- How accurate/believable a text was or wasn't

It is really important that you choose aspects that allow you to delve deeply into the text.  It's easy to choose a character and respond to him, but it's harder to get Excellence if you choose a character that does nothing challenging or controversial or interesting. 
Try and stay away from the cliched ideas
